# LanguageLessons 
In short: A prototype language learning tool
# Overview
This is a Java-based application created as a learning exercise and fun side-project.

The goal of the application is to provide the user with a foundation for learning a new language.

It aims to do this by providing ways for the user to encounter, repeat and explore grammar and vocabulary.

To achieve this, the app uses a pre-defined (and evolving) model for how a language (and all its parts) are presented and interacted with.



# How to use the app (as a user)

Development is currently in early stages. More info on the app's design to follow!
